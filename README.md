# first_server
1) Json file start ka value rakh die toh npm start krne pe le lega.
cases when server nameis big we use this method.

2) start used here is defined keyword .. but we can use self declared name to run we just need to use run before declared variable;
"runthis" : "node server.js" => in this we can run the serve by using (npm run runthis).

3) nodemon is a type of server runner = > using this we dont need to run server again again.

4) nodemon ki sari dependencies are in package-lock .

5)  .gitignore => used to ignore files u dont wanna upload on git hub;
 
6) and then if someone want to download those files under gitignore user can use => npm i in terminal;
